# Additional Features
- Implemented drag-and-drop functionality to reorder tasks.

# Improvements
If I had more time, here are some improvements and additional features I would consider adding:

- User authentication system to allow multiple users to have their own task lists.
- Ability to set due dates and reminders for tasks.
- Implementing data persistence using a proper backend server and database.
- Adding search filter functionality to easily find tasks.
- Enhancing the UI/UX with more interactive features and animations.
- Implemented a theme toggle functionality to switch between light and dark modes.
